        <h3>Food Description</h3>
        <p>
            Pizza is a beloved Italian dish celebrated globally for its versatility and deliciousness. It consists of a round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, such as meats, vegetables, and condiments. These toppings can be customized to suit personal tastes, making pizza a versatile option for any meal. Traditionally baked in a wood-fired oven, pizza features a characteristically chewy, crisp crust, a flavorful sauce, and a melty cheese topping. From the classic Margherita to more inventive creations, pizza embodies the essence of Italian culinary art with a global twist, enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pre-made pizza dough or flatbread</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>Toppings of your choice</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat as well.</li>
            <li>Roll out your pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the rolled-out dough to a piece of parchment paper or a lightly greased baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the surface of the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Arrange your chosen toppings on top of the cheese. Sprinkle with oregano and basil.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pizza (on the parchment paper, if using) to the preheated oven or pizza stone. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly golden.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve hot.</li>
           
        </ol>
