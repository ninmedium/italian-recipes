        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 jar (24 ounces) of your favorite marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 container (15 ounces) ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions, then drain and set aside. Add a little oil to the water to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>In a skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef until no longer pink. Season with a little salt and pepper. Drain any excess fat.</li>
            <li>Stir the marinara sauce into the cooked meat and simmer for about 5 minutes. This is your meat sauce.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese, 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, the Parmesan cheese, and the egg. This is your cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>In a 9x13 inch baking dish, start with a layer of meat sauce, then a layer of noodles (3 should fit across), and a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with meat sauce on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil, sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese on top, and bake uncovered for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna cool for about 10 minutes before slicing. Garnish with chopped parsley if desired, and serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
